      'desc': 'Explorer 1 marked the United States’ first step into the dawn of the Space Age. ' +
        'Just three months prior in November, 1957, the Soviet Union had launched humanity’s second ' +
        'satellite into orbit. By this point, the United States was under immense pressures to compete' +
        ' with the Soviet achievement, which only mounted when the U.S. Navy\'s Vanguard rocket exploded ' +
        'on the launch pad with the United States\' first attempt to launch a satellite. Explorer 1 had ' +
        'been in the works at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and was quickly readied for launch. On ' +
        'January 31, 1958 it made orbit and became not only the first U.S. satellite, but also the first' +
        ' science satellite. Its first discovery was of the Van Allen radiation belts, a collection of ' +
        'charged particles trapped in the Earth’s magnetic field. Trapped there, the charged particles ' +
        'don\'t harm Earth or life on it, but they can pose a threat to orbiting satellites and astronauts.' +
        ' Understanding the dynamics of this region is essential for protecting technological assets and ' +
        'planning crewed space missions. This discovery opened the doors of space exploration, the first' +
        ' of many in the last 60 years about our planet, our solar system and the cosmos.',

      'title': 'Solar Eclipse',
      'desc': 'Solar eclipse is a celestial event in which the moon passes between the Sun and Earth and' +
        ' blocks all or part of the Sun for up to about three hours. Most of that time you see a partial' +
        ' eclipse, where the moon covers only a part of the Sun. To see a total eclipse, where the moon' +
        ' fully covers the Sun for a short few minutes, you must be in the path of totality. The path of' +
        ' totality is a relatively thin ribbon, around 50 miles wide. Solar eclipses are fairly numerous,' +
        ' about 2 to 4 per year. In any given location on Earth, a total eclipse happens only once every ' +
        'hundred years or so, though for selected locations they can occur as little as a few years apart' +
        '. Looking directly at the Sun without appropriate protection, except during totality, could ' +
        'severely hurt your eyes. However, there are many ways to safely view an eclipse of the Sun.' +
        ' They require some type of filtering device, like special eclipse glasses.',

      'title': 'World on Fire',
      'desc': 'On Earth, something is always burning. Wildfires are started by lightning or accidentally' +
        ' by people, and people use controlled fires to manage farmland and pasture and clear natural ' +
        'vegetation for farmland. Fires can generate large amounts of smoke pollution, release greenhouse' +
        ' gases, and unintentionally degrade ecosystems. But fires can also clear away dead and dying' +
        ' underbrush, which can help restore an ecosystem to good health. In many ecosystems, including' +
        ' boreal forests and grasslands, plants have co-evolved with fire and require periodic burning ' +
        'to reproduce.',

      'title': 'The World\'s Highest Mountains',
      'desc': 'Fourteen mountain peaks stand taller than 8000 meters (26247 feet). There could have' +
        ' been many more of these “eight-thousanders” if, in 1793, the French commission that ' +
        'established the length of the meter had made it just a bit shorter. Yet the decision to make a' +
        ' meter equivalent to one ten-millionth of the distance between the equator and the North Pole' +
        ' left the world with only this handful. All of them are found in either the Karakoram or ' +
        'Himalayan mountain ranges of central Asia. Ground photography of the towering peaks is ' +
        'ubiquitous, but images captured by NASA’s EO-1 satellite offer a less familiar perspective. ' +
        'The sensor on EO-1 looked directly down on the mountains, providing a view of the very tip of' +
        ' each summit. Glaciers have chiseled Everest’s summit into a huge, triangular pyramid defined' +
        ' by three major faces and ridges. K2’s modern nickname is “Savage Mountain” because of the' +
        ' extreme risks it poses to climbers—frequent avalanches and harsh weather. Kangchenjunga, ' +
        'the third highest peak in the world, is the most easterly of the eight-thousanders. Despite' +
        ' being the fourth highest mountain in the world, Lhotse is often overshadowed by its neighbor,' +
        ' Mount Everest. Makalu’s classic pyramid shape is the product of bowl-shaped cirque glaciers ' +
        'grinding away at the summit on all sides.',
